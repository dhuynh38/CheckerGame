# Civilization Game
A replication of the famous Checker game using Java and Swing. I developed this in high school when
I took AP Computer Science. I worked with a friend to develop this game. However, I wrote the majority
of the code and the graphics.

To run the game, execute the command in the command line:
java -jar Checker.jar
